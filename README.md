# README

## Hi, this is a rushed README

Please be gentle! It's a hot mess, it works but at what cost...<br>
(The options button doesn't go anywhere, it's a placeholder for future DLC (paid))

- DOWNLOAD this repo onto your computer
- Go to your terminal/command line and navigate to the DonutCat2 folder.
- Execute the following commands, one at a time:

<h3>Setup (first time only)</h3>

### Step 1

    python -m venv venv
    
### Step 2

    source venv/bin/activate

### Step 3

    pip install pygame

Steps 1-3 should only be necessary for the initial setup

Once Steps 1-3 are done, execute Step 4 below.

### Step 4

    python main_menu.py

To run the game after the initial setup, just activate the venv as in Step 2, then start the game using Step 4.

## Happy playing!
